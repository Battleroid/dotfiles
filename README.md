dotfiles
========

Things I generally reuse, and vim junk. Don't blame me for problems or issues that may arise from using any of this.

vim
===

Note: Most of the features, plugins, packages, etc rely on the latest vim compiled from source. You can try using my `buildvim.sh` deal, though, don't hold me liable if it doesn't work or messes up.

Remember to compile with these options:

```bash
./configure --enable-pythoninterp \
	--enable-rubyinterp \
	--enable-luainterp \
	--with-python-config-dir=/path/to/python/config \
	--with-features=huge \
	--enable-cscope
```

i3
==

I still have no clue what I am doing with i3, I love it though, reminds me of 'Arrange' by Trifle for OS X, except way better.

Would love to get some simple icons in the status bar so I can intepret the information easier.

X
=

Xresources, etc.

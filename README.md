dotfiles
========

Things I generally reuse, and vim junk. Don't blame me for problems or issues that may arise from using any of this.

Start over fresh, in with the new, out with the old.

## Also

If on laptop and installing stuff manually, if you want lid close to cause sleep edit `/etc/default/acpi-support` and change the appropriate lines.

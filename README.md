dotfiles
========

Things I generally reuse, and vim junk.

vim
===

Note: Most of the features, plugins, packages, etc rely on the latest vim compiled from source.

Remember to compile with these options:

```
./configure --enable-pythoninterp \
	--enable-rubyinterp \
	--enable-luainterp \
	--with-python-config-dir=/path/to/python/config \
	--with-features=huge \
	--enable-cscope
```

i3

I still have no clue what I am doing with i3, I love it though, reminds me of 'Arrange' by Trifle for OS X, except way better.

Would love to get some simple icons in the status bar so I can intepret the information easier.
